 My first game project in unity. I should rather say a conncept were I'm creating simple agents with "neural brain" that should be trained with simple genetic neural networks algorithm. The main idea behind is to let agents learn how to survive in the world were they cannot hit obstacles and they need to catch energy orbs. In future genetic algorithm should be replaced with NEAT (topological augmentation) algorithm.
